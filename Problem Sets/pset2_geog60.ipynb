    "Right, so we don't know what the future holds. \n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to predicting climate change, this is a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the fact that we don't know what technology will emerge in the coming decades, what policies will be in place, what demographic changes will occur, geopolitical and socio-economic factors will become determinant, and how all of those things together will conspire to shape fossil fuel consumption. It is, as we say, uncertain: many outcomes are consistent with expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So rather than **predict** the future, climate scientists work to **project** the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "We make \"projections,\" not \"predictions\". This is not pedantic. The distinction matters. ***A prediction is a forecast.*** Weather models make predictions. It is a statement about the future based on our best knowledge of the present. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, ***a projection is a prediction that is \"conditioned\" on a set of assumptions.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of it as an `IF->THEN`, type of prediction. Here we scientists condition our prediction of future on assumptions about greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in our atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "So rather than predict what our socio-economic and political structures will be, scientists **sample** from the range of plausible possibilities: a world with high concentrations of GHGs, low GHGs, and a bunch of possibilities in between, for example. To be clear, there are no likelihoods attached to any of these concentration pathways. They're simply possibilities. **They are not policy recommendations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In climate parlance, these time-dependent trajectories of future GHG concentrations are called [**Representative Concentration Pathways**](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-011-0148-z). These pathways are all called \"RCPs\" and the number that follows, 8.5, 7, 4.5, etc., refers to the approximate top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiative imbalance (or forcing) at 2100 due to the concentration trajectory, i.e., $\\Delta(\\text{IN} - \\text{OUT})$. So RCP8.5 has about 8.5 W m$^{-2}$ radiative imbalance at 2100. Recall our linearization of the forcing-response relationship from class, which can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta F =\\lambda\\Delta T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher $\\Delta F$ is going to mean a larger $\\Delta T$: more forcing equals more warming. You plug up more of the drain in our bathtub, the water level has to rise more to reach equilibrium, such that $\\text{IN} = \\text{OUT}$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "From: Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "The RCPs are physical boundary conditions for the climate model: at each time step, the atmosphere has this many parts per million (ppm) of CO$_2$ or that many parts per billion (ppb) CH$_4$. Implicitly, these choices suggest something about our society and its development, but not explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can imagine, for example, that there are many ways our society could arrive at the same level of radiative forcing. Perhaps a high forcing world like RCP8.5, for instance, could only occur becuase everyone relies exclusively on fossil fuels and no countries cooperate on climate change. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to make these societal possibilities explicit, scientists developed a **scenario framework** to generate societal narratives that are consistent with the physics-based RCPs. To do so, they used another class of model that couples the climate and economy together (usually very simplistically) called [**Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs)**](https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-integrated-assessment-models-are-used-to-study-climate-change/). IAMs are themselves fed assumptions about technological progress, wealth discrepancies, levels of international cooperation, and the like, and then spit out trajectories of population growth and gross domestic product (GDP) change consistent with RCPs. \n",
    "\n",
    "These narratives are called [Shared Socioeconomic Pathways](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-013-0905-2). There are five of them, each of which posits the possibilities for differing challenges to adaptation (i.e., managing climate impacts) and differing challenges to mitigation (i.e., preventing climate impacts). \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "These scenarios or pathways explore various hypothetical ways in which the world might change in the future, and so scientists combine the SSPs and RCPs together, and they are the **scenario** given to an Earth system model. They represent boundary conditions to a climate experiment, where the answer is a **projection** conditioned on the assumptions of the **scenario**. These are all used as part of [ScenarioMIP](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/3461/2016/), one of the coordinated experiments under [CMIP](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Again, these scenarios have no likelihoods attached to them. They are not predictions of what will happen. They are a small sampling of scenario space -- a small set from the larger set of plausible futures. They are intended to give us a starting point to assess how climate change could unfold IF society looked one way versus another.**\n",

Use the argument `alpha=0.2` for this function so that the ranges are partially transparent (there will help us visualize the model uncertainty ranges in the case of any overlap).\n",
