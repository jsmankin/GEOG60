    "\n",
    "A blackbody absorbs and emits light (electromagnetic energy) at all wavelengths and a blackbody curve, or \"Planck function\" tells us the relationship between the intensity of the light being emitted at a particular wavelength (or frequency or wavenumber). \n",

    "So blackbody radiation is useful in that it relates energy (which we know, because $IN=OUT$) to temperature (which we do not know, but want to know). \n",
    "\n",
    "Blackbody phyics tells us that if we assume Earth behaves mostly like a blackbody, that it must heat up to some emission temperature, $T_e$, to ensure that it is radiating enough energy back out to space such that we balance the books (i.e., that $IN=OUT$). \n",
    "\n",
    "We did a bit of alegra, invoked a tiny bit of geometry, and based on a conceptual model and a list of factors we thought mattered, we came up with a model that says that the light absorbed by Earth (i.e., the $IN$ side of the equation) is balanced by the light Earth radiates back out to space. We assumed, for simplicity, that Earth absorbs and emits light at all the frequencies (i.e., that Earth behaves like a **blackbody radiator** with effective global mean **emission temperature $T_e$**):"

The Earth heats up from the ground to some temperature and in response, it emits light at a frequency consistent with Wien's Law. For the Earth, its temperature sets up longwave emission back up to space. But that longwave radiation or light, does get absorbed by the gases in our atmopshere. That longwave light is playing the same \"musical note\" that the molecules know how to play, and so the molecules resonate and absorb that longwave radiation. \n",
