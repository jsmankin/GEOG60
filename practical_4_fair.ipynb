    "## 0. Recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "Where are we? Let's put together the pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. We've thought about the Earth as a **system** wanting to acheive balance or **equilibrium**, just like a bathtub, through a **negative feedback**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{IN} = \\text{OUT}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We've learned that the Earth acheives this balance by absorbing shortwave light from the sun and radiating longwave infrared light to space based on its temperature, all consistent with **Stefan-Boltzmann** and $\\sigma T^4$ â€” a negative feedback, called the **Planck Feedback**. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. We learned that this equilibrium is actually aided by **convection**, a **choatic processes** (i.e., a sensitive dependence on **initial conditions**) that arises because of the differential heating of our planet and because of the vertical structure of our atmosphere. This is part of a wider process called **radiative-convective equilibrium**, which itself is shaped by feedbacks, such as the negative **lapse rate** feedback. So we learned a bit of atmospheric dynamics: differential heating induces differential densities inducing differential pressures, which gets air moving, as high pressure wants to equilibriate with low pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We learned that simulating a system is hard because we can't do calculus on a computer (so errors are baked in), and in particular, simulating processes like convection is hard, first because is we don't have perfect measurements everywhere at every instant, and because computers have finite memory, and because the length scales and temporal scales of convection are small, making it incredibly computationally expensive to simulate (halving our spatial resolution ($\\Delta X$) forces us to halve our timestep ($\\Delta t$), making the cost $2^4=16$ more expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We learned that climate models deal with this by **parameterizing** processes that occur on spatiotemporal scales smaller than a **grid box**, or a unit volume in a climate model that closes the **energy, mass, and momentum budgets**. These **unresolved** parameterizations, like our runoff module, influence the **resolved** processes in climate models, so the fine-scale influences the large-scale. There are a host of feedbacks within Earth's climate system, and the goal of the models is to get all of these processes and feedbacks represented to make predictions conditioned on a set of assumptions (or what we call a **projection**), such as what happens if we increase $\\text{CO}_2$ at a rate of 1% per year. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. We've read that there are lots of [**IPCC**](https://www.ipcc.ch/) models out there, built by national labs around the world, all coordinating with each other to perfrom the same set of experiments, under the aegis of a program called the **Coupled Model Intercomparison Project**, which allows us to compare all the answers from different models given the same experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. We've read that there are modeling best practices for evaluating the performance of these models and experiments, in particular, their representation of these key feedbacks, which ultimately determine what the temperature response of the planet is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we're caught up...\n"
