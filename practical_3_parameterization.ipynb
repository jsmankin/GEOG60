    "These past weeks, we've learned that in order to solve the energy budget more accurately that we need to consider the vertical structure of our atmosphere—its distributon of mass and temperature, and what those things imply about the conditions for getting air moving. Then we learned about chaotic determinism and convection, which laid the groundwork for understanding [**radiative-convective equilibrium**](https://texmex.mit.edu/pub/emanuel/Powerpoint/LMD_Lectures_2018/RCE_lecture_Paris_2018.pdf), namely that our planet cools itself by convecting warm moist air aloft, near space, where clouds can radiate out more efficiently. \n",

If the time step is longer than this, more than one grid box is traversed in a single time step, so the model will not properly resolve motion of small-scale features.
